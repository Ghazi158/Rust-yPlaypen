# Rust_Learning_Road
Hi there curious person, you found me. 
Not much I can give you here except an exciting news that I am learning [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ....Yay!

# Why? 
Well, Every language is good...Rust is just.. better at doing everything they can, but better.. and [faster](https://kornel.ski/rust-c-speed)!

# So? What's the plan?
I'm going to be sharing all open-source projects/programs that I write in Rust (Maybe I might even re-write [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) in Rust!!!?!).

# Awesome! What kind of Projects?
Well.. Since I'm in the learning phase and I think we all forever will be; Really anything from as small as a simple CLI program that gives you a "Hello!" specific number of times when you're promoted for a number, to... hopefully, something that I can stick game developement in? We will see with time. EXPECT MY CODE TO BE THE WORST YOU'VE EVER SEEN

# Can we help? 
Ofcourse.. I'd love help, but beware I will simply be doing the "do as I learn", that meaning that whatever i've learnt, i will try to create something with it; In a more exemplary way, creating a CLI Calculator with if/else because.. that's all I know so far about Rust even if later on I can learn a more faster and more convenient way of re-writing the same program, when I do, I will surely re-write it the correct way too!!

# Great, best of luck
Thank you!
